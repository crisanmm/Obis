    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>Obis is an application that let's you view and access statistics about obesity in the United States. Data is collected by telephone surveys, the data is provided by Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).</p>
    <p>In order to make it easy for everyone to see and use the data BRFSS gathered, we offer:

    <ul>
        <li>An API that can be accesed while having an account</li> 
        <li>Different charts to display the situation in USA</li> 
        <li>Comparisions between different states</li>
        <li>Means to download the charts in 3 different formats</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our goal is to facilitate an easy interaction between the given data and users, using self explanatory, visual charts.</p>

    <h2 id="home">Home Page</h2>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/d8BFh0g.png" alt="homepage">

    <p>When you first enter our website you will land on the home page as shown above. It has a short description of our application as well as a BMI calculator, provided by <a href="https://bmicalculatorireland.com">BMI Calculator Ireland</a>.</p>
    
    <p>On the left (or at the bottom of the page if you are on a mobile) are located links to our data sources such as BRFSS main page and CDC tools.</p>
    
    <p>The navigation bar offers you a quick overlook of what pages we have available. In the footer you can navigate to our github repository (if we decide to make it public) and our faculty main page.</p>
    
    <p>From here you can explore the website but for this guide we will head over login and register pages, because, after registration, you will gain acces to all of our features.</p>
    
    <p>Click on the yellow button situated in the far right of the menu bar (it should say LOG IN).</p>

    <h2 id="login">Login Page</h2>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/B8jLvu7.png" alt="loginpage">

    <p>Now you find yourself on the login page, which has a minimalistic design. Since you don't have an account yet (probably) you should press the "REGISTER HERE" button.</p> 
    
    <p>If you do have an account you can simply fill in the form with your email and password and hit "LOG IN". If the login was successful, you will be redirected on the home page. Your name should appear on the right of the menu as well. Otherwise, if not successful, you will be prompted with a "Login failed" message.</p>

    <p>If pressed, the "REGISTER HERE" button will take you to the register page</p>

    <h2 id="reg">Register Page</h2>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/18xSykP.png" alt="registerpage">

    <p>Once you get here you can create your account by filling in your First and Last Name, as well as a valid Email address and a password. You have to confirm your password.</p>

    <p>When done, just press the "REGISTER" button below.If done correctly, you should now have a valid account you can use to get acces to our statistics page, otherwise a prompt will show, stating a failed registration.</p>

    <p>If the registration was successful, you will be redirected to the login page where you should enter the credentials of the account you just created.</p>

    <p>From now you should have acces to our statistics page so let's take a look. To make sure you are logged in, your name should appear in the menu, in place of "LOG IN". If not, trying to access the statistics page will look like this:</p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cQRYMRQ.png" alt="statisticspagefail">

    <p>If you do get this, then you should go back in the guide and check where you might have done something wrong. If you don't get this page then everything went fine and you are now logged in.</p>


    <h2 id="stat">Statistics Page</h2>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HCoZ84I.png" alt="statisticspage">

    <p>To get here you should click on the STATISTICS link displayed in the menu and be logged in.</p>

    <p>At first, it may seem hard to understand what are these charts all about, but we will talk about each one of them shortly.</p>

    <p>The Statistics Page is divided in 3 main parts: A piechart, a comparision collumn chart and an USA map.</p>

    <p>The piechart represents a total of 100% of what has been chosen for filters. You have 2 options here, to filter by BMI or by Category. BMI filtering will give you the % of each breakout of the selected category for the selected BMI. The Category filtering will display the % of each BMI category of the selected breakout. You can pick one state and year at a time.</p>

    <p>The collumn charts does the same thing as the piechart but with the addition of comparision between 2 states. This is done by selecting each state in the filters below the chart. You can pick only one year at a time.</p>

    <p>The USA map shows the % of selected BMI category for the selected subcategory.</p>

    <p>A main feature of our application is that you can download the generated charts in 3 different formats: SVG, CSV and WebP. To get them select the format you want and press the button EXPORT situated bellow the preferred chart.</p>

    <p>From now on you know how to use the main functionality of our website. But what if you want to change your name? Or your email address?. For that, you should press where now it should be your name, in the right corner of the menu</p>

    <h2 id="admin">User Panel</h2>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dUo7QfD.png" alt="userpanel">

    <p>Here you can change you First and Second name as well as your email address. Filling the form and pressign "CHANGE ACCOUNT DATA" will update your account credentials.</p>

    <p>If you want to log out, you will have to press the "LOG OUT" button, situated bellow the form.</p>

    <p>If you are an admin however, the above illustrated page will look different.</p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6oq2uL7.png" alt="adminpanel">

    <p>As you can see,an Admin has access to uploading, updating and deleting data from our database. A normal user cannot obtain this priviledge unless given by the owners the website.</p>
