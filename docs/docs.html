            <h2>Abstract</h2>

            <p> Obis is an application that let's you view and access statistics about obesity in the United States.
                Data is
                collected by telephone surveys, the data is provided by Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
                (BRFSS).
                This document goes into detail about the implementation of the application.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Obesity in the United States is a major health issue resulting in numerous diseases, specifically
                increased
                risk
                of certain types of cancer, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, as well as significant
                increases
                in early mortality and economic costs.
            </p>

            <p>"Obesity" is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 and over, and the measure of "Adult Obesity" from
                the
                BRFSS
                encapsulates the self-reported prevalence of obesity among adults for the civilian non-institutionalized
                population 18 years and over</p>
            <p>In order to make it easy for everyone to see and use the data BRFSS gathered, we offer:
                <ul>
                    <li>An API that can be accesed while having an account</li>
                    <li>Different charts to display the situation in USA</li>
                    <li>Comparisions between different states</li>
                    <li>Means to download the charts in 3 different formats</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Our goal is to facilitate an easy interaction between the given data and users, using self explanatory,
                visual
                charts.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="proj">
            <h2>Project Requirements</h2>

            <p> Make a WEB application to visualise BRFSS data with the following specifications: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use data provided by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm">BRFSS</a></li>
                <li>Create a REST API</li>
                <li>Comparisions between states</li>
                <li>3 different charts to display data</li>
                <li>Facilitate chart export as CSV, WebP and SVG</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning
                    and
                    structure of web content.</p>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                    written
                    in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on
                    other
                    media.</p>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <p>JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                    object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles. We choose JS because this project required a
                    programming language capable of making dynamic and interactive web pages by implementing custom
                    client-side
                    scripts.</p>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <p>We choose PHP because is a robust programming language and it has an extensive list of core
                    functionality
                    which includes cross-platform adaptability, multi-browser compatibility, secure web apps and so on.
                    Compared
                    to other web languages, PHP is an efficient language which supports all major web servers to deliver
                    high
                    performance consistently.</p>
                <li>MariaDB</li>
                <p>It came with the XAMPP pack, and it is exceptionally quick, regardless of the underlying platform. It
                    features self-management capabilities like auto restart, space expansion and automatic configuration
                    changes
                    for ease of management.</p>
                <li>Apache</li>
                <p>Like the database, the Apache server came along with XAMPP. With the tool ngrok, we were able to
                    redirect
                    localhost to a public adress. Apache proved to be reliable and secure.</p>
                <li>AJAX</li>
                <p>AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the
                    server
                    behind
                    the scenes. For us to be able to update the charts without refreshing the page we choose to use
                    AJAX.
                </p>
                <li>REST</li>
                <p>One of the main features of our website is the API we offer. In order to achieve a complete set of
                    capabilities we created a RESTful API utilising CRUD functionality.</p>
                <li>CSV</li>
                <p>CSV files are plain-text files, making them easier for the website developer to create. The data we
                    got
                    from
                    BRSFF was in a csv format, making it simple to upload it to our database.</p>
                <li>JSON</li>
                <p>The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network
                    connection.
                    It
                    is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative
                    to
                    XML.
                </p>
                <li>JWT</li>
                <p>We choose to generate a token for every user in order to acces our API. This keeps the database
                    secure
                    and
                    avoids bloated/spam like requests. (bots)</p>
            </ul>

        <section id="valid">
            <h2>Validation</h2>

            <p> For HTML validation we used https://validator.w3.org and we got no errors or warnings.</p>
            <p> For CSS validation we used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and we got no errors or warnings.</p>

        <section id="user">
            <h2>User Interaction</h2>

            <p>An average user's interaction with the web application is portrayed in the following diagram:</p>

                <figcaption>User interaction diagram</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>It is important to keep in mind that in order to access the statistics page the user has to be logged in
                first so a JWT is generated. In all other situations the user is prompted to login.</p>

        <section id="design">
            <h2>UI Design</h2>
            <p>A basic user interface has been created in order to support the application. The application has been

                        <p>At the beginning of the project I created a prototype menu/navigation bar fully responsive
                            and
                            working. Later on it got scrapped as we settled on a different task management.</p>

                        <span class="bold">Charts</span>
                        <p>Because I took the frontend scripting, I also integrated the charts with the help of Google
                            Chart API. It was also my job to handle the data and create ways to filter and display
                            the data given, in as many ways as possible.</p>

                            integrating CRUD operations and basic server-database interaction. Later on some parts were
                            refactored by my colleague.

                            made a separate API handling login and register but later on we switch to php registration
                            through forms. As for JWT generating and checking (validating) it was still done by me. </p>

            <h2>Code Management System</h2>

            For this project we decided we are going to use github. Git is the most commonly used version control
            system.
            Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to
            specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple
            people to all be merged into one source. This proved to be crucial because different changes were added at
            the
            same time, as we worked in parallel. We were able to track commit changes and discover where an issue was
            created, making it easier to solve, without changing large chunks of code.
